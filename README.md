# Number-Series-Position-Finder
This is a Python Project to generate a series by concatenating natural numbers (1, 2, 3...) and stopping when a user - specified sequence position is reached. The project prints the series up to that position and identifies the digit located at the exact position.

Overview
- This project includes two Python functions focused on string manipulation and digit position analysis for number series:

- The first function generates a concatenated number series and identifies the digit at a specific user - inputted position.

- The second function accepts any given number series string and reports the digit at the final position.​

Features
- User input for sequence length or series string

- Dynamic string manipulation using loops

- Position -   based digit extraction

- Clear output statements for educational presentation​

Technologies/Tools Used
- Python 3.13.5

Steps to Install & Run the Project
- Clone the repository.

- Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.

- Run the script with:

- python filename.py
(Replace filename.py with your actual script name.)

Instructions for Testing
  
- Task 1: When input is taken, enter a position number. The script will display the generated series and the digit found at that position.

- Task 2: Enter a concatenated series string. The script outputs the last digit and its corresponding position.
